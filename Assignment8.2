Problem Statement

I decided to treat this as a classification problem by creating a new binary variable affair
(did the woman have at least one affair?) and trying to predict the classification for each
woman.
Dataset
The dataset I chose is the affairs dataset that comes with Statsmodels. It was derived
from a survey of women in 1974 by Redbook magazine, in which married women were
asked about their participation in extramarital affairs. More information about the study
is available in a 1978 paper from the Journal of Political Economy.
Description of Variables
The dataset contains 6366 observations of 9 variables:
rate_marriage: woman's rating of her marriage (1 = very poor, 5 = very good)
age: woman's age
yrs_married: number of years married
children: number of children
religious: woman's rating of how religious she is (1 = not religious, 4 = strongly religious)
educ: level of education (9 = grade school, 12 = high school, 14 = some college, 16 =
college graduate, 17 = some graduate school, 20 = advanced degree)

X = X.rename(columns = {'C(occupation)[T.2.0]':'occ_2',
'C(occupation)[T.3.0]':'occ_3',
'C(occupation)[T.4.0]':'occ_4',
'C(occupation)[T.5.0]':'occ_5',
'C(occupation)[T.6.0]':'occ_6',
'C(occupation_husb)[T.2.0]':'occ_husb_2',
'C(occupation_husb)[T.3.0]':'occ_husb_3',
'C(occupation_husb)[T.4.0]':'occ_husb_4',
'C(occupation_husb)[T.5.0]':'occ_husb_5',
'C(occupation_husb)[T.6.0]':'occ_husb_6'})
y = np.ravel(y)
